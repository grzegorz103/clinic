# Simple clinic management system

* There are two nurses (ID 1 or 2) who are able to add new patients to the clinic system and five doctors
* Every patient gets his ID which may be used to log in and register for a visit to a specified doctor
* Each doctor is able to see his upcoming visits with such info as patient's disease
